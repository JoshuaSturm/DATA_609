# Chapter 6 problems

## 1 (Page 228, exercise #1)
Consider a model for the long-term dining behavior of the students at College USA. It is found that 25% of the students who eat at the college's Grease Dining Hall return to eat there again, whereas those who eat at Sweet Dining Hall have a 93% return rate. These are the only two dining halls available on campus, and assume that all students eat at one of these halls. Formulate a model to solve for the long-term percentage of students eating at each hall.

### 1 Solution
The transitional matrix is

```{r}
# trans_mat <- data.frame("1" = c("Grease", "Sweet"), "Grease" = c("0.25", "0.07"), "Sweet" = c("0.75", "0.93"))
# names(trans_mat)[1] <- ""
# kable(trans_mat, "latex", booktabs = T) %>%
#   kable_styling(latex_options = "striped")
trans_mat <- matrix(c(0.25, 0.75, 0.07, 0.93), nrow = 2, byrow = T)

markov_chain <- new("markovchain", transitionMatrix = trans_mat, states = c("Grease", "Sweet"), name = "Markov Chain 1")
markov_chain
```

And the markov chain is show plotted below:

```{r}
plot(markov_chain)
```

Let $G_n$ = the percentage of students who eat at Grease Dining Hall at the end of period $n$. \\
Let $S_n$ = the percentage of students who eat at Sweet DininG Hall at the end of period $n$.

Then,

$G_{n+1} = 0.25G_n + 0.07S_n$ \\
$S_{n+1} = 0.75G_n + 0.93S_n$

We can visualize the model's prediction over time.

```{r}
# Begin by defining the functions for each dining hall
grease <- function(g, s){
  return(0.25 * g + 0.07 * s)
}

sweet <- function(g, s){
  return(0.75 * g + 0.93 * s)
}

# For simplicity's sake, begin with each dining hall having 50% of the student population
# We'll see if the model converges within 10 timesteps
df <- data.frame(n = 0:10, Grease = 0.5, Sweet = 0.5)

# Apply the function at each timestep
for(i in 1:10){
  df$Grease[i+1] <- round(grease(df$Grease[i], df$Sweet[i]), 7)
  df$Sweet[i+1] <- round(sweet(df$Grease[i], df$Sweet[i]), 7)
}
df
```

We can see the model converges after 10 timesteps.

To view this graphically:

```{r}
dfmelt <- df %>%
  gather(key = DiningHall, value = value, Grease, Sweet)

ggplot(data = dfmelt, aes(x = n, y = value, colour = DiningHall)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10)
```

## 2 (Page 232, exercise #1)
Consider a stereo with CD player, FM-AM radio tuner, speakers (dual), and power amplifier (PA) components, as displayed with the reliabilities shown in Figure 6.11. Determine the system's reliability. What assumptions are required in your model?

### 2 Solution
We can divide it into three parts: 
 - The PA system
 - The CD and FM-AM radio
 - Speaker 1 and speaker 2
 
Let $R_1, R_2,$ and $R_3$ represent the above three parts, respectively.

Then,

\begin{align*}
R_1 &= 0.95 \\
R_2 &= R_2(1) + R_2(2) - (R_2(1)\times R_2(2)) = 0.98 + 0.97 - (0.98\times 0.97) = `r 0.98 + 0.97 - (0.98 * 0.97)` \\
R_3 &= R_3(1) + R_3(2) - (R_3(1)\times R_3(2)) = 0.99 + 0.99 - (0.99\times 0.99) = `r 0.99 + 0.99 - (0.99 * 0.99)`
\end{align*}

The reliability of the system as whole is $R_1 \times R_2 \times R_3$.

$R = 0.95 \times 0.9994 \times 0.9999 =$ `r 0.95 * 0.9994 * 0.9999`.
