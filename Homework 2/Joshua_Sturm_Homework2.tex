For the scenarios presented in problem 9-17, identify a problem worth
studying and list the variables that affect the behavior you have
identified. Which variables would be neglected completely? Which might
be considered as constants initially? Can you identify any submodels you
would want to study in detail? Identify any data you would want
collected.

\indent A company with a fleet of trucks faces increasing maintenance
costs as the age and mileage of the trucks increase.

\hypertarget{solution}{%
\subsubsection{1 Solution}\label{solution}}

The company may want to perform a study to determine whether it makes
financial sense to continue sinking money into an aging asset, or
whether it may be more economical to invest in a new fleet.

Some possible variables that would need to be considered include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fuel efficiency of current fleet
\item Is it a buyer's or seller's market for used cars?
\item Company's ability to secure low-interest financing
\item Viability of renting / leasing vehicles
\item Potential insurance savings by upgrading to newer, safer vehicles
\item Routine / preventative maintenance
\end{itemize}

The company may opt to neglect the second variable, since resale value
may not be an important factor, given that they got their use out of the
vehicles, and they may need to upgrade regardless of the sunken cost.

We could say that routine maintenance, such as oil changes, filter
replacements, etc, are constant variables.

We could break the model up into several parts, where the underlying
question is whether to invest in and keep using the current fleet, or
upgrade to a new one. The model can then be broken down further to
determine whether the company should buy or lease their new vehicles.

Suppose the company was exploring the feasibility of maintaining their
current fleet, they would need to research costs of replacement parts
(e.g.~transmission). They would also need to expect more frequent
vehicle failures, which would lead to downtime and lost productivity.

Determine whether the data set supports the stated proportionality
model.
